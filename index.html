      <h4>The man behind the legend</h4>
      <p>
        When it comes to railroad folklore, none compares in popularity to the legend of Casey Jones. True american hero and expert locomotive engineer.
      </p>
      <p>Born in southeastern Missouri, John Luther Jones moved to Cayce, KY as a young boy. At the age of 15 John moved to the town of Columbus, KY, this is where he adopted the nickname "Casey" from his former town and began his career on the railroad as a telegrapher for Mobile and Ohio (M&O). In 1886 Casey moved to Jackson, TN where he was promoted to flagman for M&O and would soon meet Joanne "Janie" Brady - his future wife.</p>
      <p>In February of 1891 while working for the Illinois Central Railroad (IC), Jones was promoted to locomotive engineer - the summit of his profession and lifeling goal. Casey Jones was well-known along the IC lines for his punctual insistence for arriving on time. While passing through towns on his line, the locals would recognize the "whooperwill" sound only Casey could make with his train whistle.</p>
      <p>After taking on a midnight run for a fellow engineer that was sick from a recent yellow fever outbreak, Casey Jones would take his last fatal ride on April 30, 1900. While taking a passenger train from Mephis, TN to Canton, MS, Jones struck a train extended to far from the side-out near the town of Vaughn, MS. Casey Jones gave his life trying to bring his roaring locomotive to a halt and saving everyone else's life on board.</p>
